# Management-System

## Description
This project utilizes MySQL2 and Inquirer to provide an interactive database for companies looking to track their employees. The interactiveness is gained by being able to add departments, roles and employees through command line prompts. Employees will be automatically attached to certain departments and salaries once a role has been chosen for them and they can also be updated.
